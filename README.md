# Rest-Assured-Demo-Project

## Intro

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities in framework setup and test writing and implementation using Rest Assured. The tests will focus on automating various scenarios on dummy APIs.

## Pre-requirements:

I used versions **v21.0.1** and **3.9.5** of Java and Maven respectively. You can use the same, later or a minimum version of Java 8.

## Installation

cd into rest-assured-demo folder and run `mvn install`.

## Tests

cd into rest-assured-demo folder and run `mvn test` or if you want to run separately the test classes, `mvn test -Dtest="BookerTest"` or `mvn test -Dtest="ParaBankTest"`.
